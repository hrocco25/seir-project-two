# Project Overview


## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

App that uses a brewery api to allow a user to search for local breweries in their area.  It will have a homepage with a header that is displayed on all of the pages.  It will also have a main section that will render the search bar first and once you search for something it will redner the serach results below search bar.  I may face some issues with the search bar and getting it to work for the crietria I want it to look for and display. I will reference other labs and homework to help me figure out how to get the search bar to work.  I may have some issues with the CSS because I haven't been focusing as much on it with the last several assignments.  I will review older work i have done as a referene on how to work with the CSS.  I will also see if I can google if ther are any specific ways i should be working with CSS and react. I may run into some problems with displaying multiple breweries at once vs just one at a time depending on what a user searches.

Home page with search bar to search through the api to find a brewery.  Once you hit the search button it will display all the results.  The results will include the name of the brewery, address, type of brewery, website link, and phone number.

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add search for specific criteria 
- save favorite breweries

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav & top image | 
| Main | This will render the main section | 
| Search | This will render the search bar | 
| Result | This will render the resutls | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the footer info | 

## Time Frames

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Planning | H | 3hrs| 1hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 2 hrs| 2hrs | hrs |
| CSS and formating | H | 5hrs| 4hrs | hrs |
| App | H | 1 hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Header | H | 3 hrs| 1hrs | hrs |
| Main | H | 4 hrs| 1hrs | hrs |
| Search | H | 6 hrs| 6hrs | hrs |
| Footer | H | 1 hrs| .2hrs | hrs |
| Total | H | 31hrs| hrs | hrs |
